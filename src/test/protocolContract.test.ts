/* THE CROSS-REPO DIFF-GUARD.
 *
 * `aios-app` and `aios-glass` both fulfil requests on the same bus, and contract 2 has them
 * RACE — so a request must behave identically whichever one wins. The two `sendQueue.ts` copies
 * had silently diverged by 248 lines, and `TIMINGS` — the block literally commented "these are
 * CONTRACT, not local tuning" — existed in only ONE of them. The only thing linking the surfaces
 * was a code comment reading `// Glass: MAX_HOLD_MS`.
 *
 * They agreed anyway, because someone hand-copied them. Nothing enforced it.
 *
 * A true diff cannot run here: these are separate repositories, so neither CI can see the other's
 * tree. What CAN travel is a HASH. Both repos record the same digest of the TIMINGS block, so
 * editing the contract in one repo fails that repo's test until the digest is updated — and the
 * digest is a 16-character string a human compares across the two PRs in one glance. It converts
 * silent drift into a visible, deliberate act.
 *
 * WHEN THIS FAILS: you changed TIMINGS. That is allowed — but it is a PROTOCOL change. Make the
 * identical edit in the other repo, recompute, update PROTOCOL_TIMINGS_SHA in BOTH, and update
 * the inbox README's invariants section. All in the same push, or a live fleet runs split-brain.
