/**
 * Spawn-inbox send queue — the pure decisions, ported from the Glass extension's
 * src/core/sendQueue.ts so the two fulfillers provably agree. Names and semantics are
 * kept IDENTICAL on purpose: if these functions ever disagree between surfaces, the
 * protocol is broken, and a diff should be the way to find out.
 *
 * The problem being solved (Glass hit it in production on 2026-07-25): the inbox has two
 * fulfillers and they RACE. A message meant for an IDE session was won by the App, which
 * consumed it (unlink on pickup), could not deliver it there, and left no trace at all.
 *
 * The fix is that the request FILE is the queue:
 *  - It is never deleted on pickup. It is CLAIMED — atomically renamed out of the
 *    watcher's `*.json` glob — and deleted only once delivery is VERIFIED.
 *  - So a race has exactly one winner (rename is atomic), a held message survives a
 *    restart (the claim is recovered), and giving up leaves a visible `.undelivered`
 *    artifact instead of silence.
 *
 * Two rules here must never soften:
 *  1. A BUSY target is never delivered into. Text sent mid-turn is dropped — it does not
 *     queue. When the hold budget runs out we report undeliverable; we do NOT "try
 *     anyway", which was Glass's 0.4.6 bug (the timeout path performed exactly the loss
 *     the gate existed to prevent).
 *  2. "The file is gone" only ever proved pickup. Delivery is proven in the TARGET'S
 *     transcript, by COUNTING occurrences — double delivery is the scariest failure mode
 *     this protocol can produce, so the expected count is exactly 1.
 *
 * Nothing here touches disk — see src/main/commandBus.ts for the IO that uses it.

 * a needle also present in other user records, one pair of `/config` invocations forty minutes
 * apart and another five hours apart.
 *
 * Both directions were live, and the noisy one was the harmless one:
 *   · FALSE VERIFIED — the dangerous direction. Any other invocation of the same command inside
 *     the verification window raises the count, the bus concludes ITS send landed, and it deletes
 *     the request. Nothing was delivered and nobody is told: a silently lost message, strictly
 *     worse than delivering twice.
 *   · FALSE DUPLICATE — two invocations inside the window read as `now - before > 1`, logging
 *     `DUPLICATE DELIVERY … INVESTIGATE` for a delivery that was perfectly fine. Since the bus
 *     trail became durable this misinformation persists and will mislead the next investigation.
 *
 * Bounding the count to records at or after the claim shrinks the window from the transcript's
 * ENTIRE history to our own hold — seconds or minutes instead of hours or days.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED on a missing timestamp: a record we cannot place in time is not counted as ours.
 * The asymmetry is deliberate and matches `DELIVERABLE_STATUSES` — counting it could mean a
 * silent loss, while not counting it means a retry and, at worst, a LOUD `.undelivered` the
 * operator can see. Prefer the noisy failure to the quiet one.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX: someone invoking the same slash command inside our own hold window is
 * still indistinguishable, because the needle cannot be made unique without altering the text we
 * type, and a slash command with a marker appended is no longer that slash command.

  /* THE 2026-08-12 BUG, half one — a busy target at VERIFY time proves nothing.
     `decideSend` refuses to type into a non-deliverable session, so a send only happens while the
     status is deliverable. The target can then go busy during the verification window, and a
     session that is mid-turn has not written the incoming turn to its transcript yet. So an empty
     transcript here distinguishes nothing, and acting on it re-types a message that may already
     have arrived.
     MEASURED, not inferred: one `/aios:close-session --auto` reached a busy session FOUR times
     (~2 min apart, no operator typing), while two IDLE targets in the same minutes verified and
     consumed on the first try. That contrast is the evidence; the precise fate of mid-turn text is
     NOT something this was able to establish — note rule 1 in this file's header, which says such
     text is dropped rather than queued. Waiting is the correct action under either reading: if it
     queued, the turn appears and we consume; if it was dropped, the target goes idle and the
     bounded retry below re-sends it once. What is never correct is concluding failure — or handing
     it to a sibling — while the target has had no chance to answer. */

  /* THE 2026-08-12 BUG, half two — `release` used to be FIRST here, and it is now gone entirely.
     Reaching this function means we already TYPED the message successfully (a surface that could
     not type it returns !ok and releases on that path, which is the case release was built for —
     see the AI-67 comment in commandBus.runSend). Handing an already-typed request to a sibling
     asks a second surface to type it AGAIN: double delivery, the one outcome this protocol calls
     explicitly worse than latency. And with a single fulfiller running there is no sibling at all,
     so the request came straight back to the same App, which re-typed it and burned a release —
     twice, to MAX_RELEASES, one step from retiring work that had already been done as a FALSE dead
     letter. `releases` is therefore no longer read here: after a successful type, the sibling
     budget is irrelevant to what we do next. */
