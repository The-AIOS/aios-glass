/**
 * #78 twin — A REUSED PID MUST NOT MAKE A CLOSED SESSION LOOK LIVE.
 *
 * Liveness was `process.kill(pid, 0)` alone. Claude Code's registry file (~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json)
 * can outlive its session, and once the OS hands that pid to an unrelated process the stale entry
 * reads as a live session — most often on Windows, which recycles pids quickly. The registry records
 * when ITS process started (`procStart`), so an entry is live only if the process now holding the pid
 * started at that time.
 *
 * The recorded format, read from real registry files (Claude Code 2.1.312, macOS, pidDomain "darwin"):
 *   "procStart": "Wed Oct 28 01:33:15 2026"   — `ps -o lstart=` rendered in UTC, second precision.
 * Claude Code computes it exactly so on macOS and Linux (`LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC ps -o lstart= -p <pid>`).
 * On Windows it writes `procStartFt` instead, a numeric string it only compares for equality; it is
 * read here as a FILETIME (100 ns ticks since 1601) only when the value is in FILETIME's plausible
 * range (below 3e17, a threshold Claude Code itself uses to tell its two Windows encodings apart).
 * Anything absent or unparseable keeps the old behaviour (signal 0 decides): never declare a session
 * dead on a field we could not read.
 *
 * This module is the PURE half, in core so sync-core hands the App the same comparison; reading the
 * actual start time is per surface (Glass: src/agents/procStart.ts).
