/**
 * AI-66 — the bus delivers a POINTER, never a truncated prompt.
 *
 * PORTED VERBATIM from aios-app/src/core/busPayload.ts, the surface that owns the working
 * implementation. Keep it byte-identical: contract 2 has the two surfaces RACE for the same
 * request, so a request must survive identically whichever one wins. If these ever diverge,
 * a diff between the two files should say so loudly.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A BYTE COUNT IN A CONTRACT
 * ------------------------------------------
 * A ~2.6KB bus send arrived cut at byte 2043, mid-sentence, with no error anywhere. The
 * dropped tail carried a "do NOT push" instruction; it was caught only because the cut
 * happened to land mid-phrase.
 *
 * The ceiling was then MEASURED rather than assumed, and it turned out not to be one number:
 *
 *   App pty, canonical mode  1024 bytes exactly   (MAX_CANON — intact at 1024, cut at 1100)
 *   App pty, raw mode        no ceiling observed  (intact at 200,000 bytes)
 *   Glass, term.sendText()   not measurable here  (inside the VS Code extension host; the
 *                                                  field observation was 2043)
 *
 * So the limit is surface-dependent, partly lives in someone else's process, and can move
 * under a dependency upgrade — silently, which is the entire failure mode. A number written
 * into the contract would be one upgrade away from being wrong while still looking right.
 *
 * Therefore the invariant is NOT "messages may be up to N bytes". It is:
 *
 *      ABOVE THE THRESHOLD, DELIVER A POINTER — NEVER THE TEXT.
 *
 * INLINE_LIMIT is 1024 because that is the one ceiling actually measured and reproducible.
 * It is a threshold for CHOOSING THE MECHANISM, not a promise about what survives: below it
 * we inline because we measured that it works; above it we stop relying on measurement at all.
 *
 * The pointer text must be self-executing — a session receiving it has to know what to do
 * without having read any documentation, because a receiving session may be running an older
 * canonical than the one that documents this.
